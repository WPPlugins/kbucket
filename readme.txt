KBucket lets you organize articles and links around categories as curated collections. Links are shared to drive traffic to your site.

== Description ==

The KBucket plugin is a place for curators to share their own editorialized research in context.  Each KBucket page (K stands for Knowledge) can store and share hundreds of links that are easily navigable through topic, author and publisher tags.

This video provides an overview of KBucket functions and features.

The curation happens in our powerful browser extension tool, Kauthor.  Kauthor lets you pin and group your sources of information (both URL's and RSS feeds) and curate and save links in multiple curation folders with simple drag and drop move.
